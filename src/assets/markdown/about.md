Hello! My name is John and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML and CSS!

Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an [advertising agency](dummy.org), [a start-up](dummy.bla), [a huge corporation](dummy.bla), and a [student-led design studio](dummy.bla). My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatementfor a variety of clients.

I also recently [launched a course](dummy.bla) that covers everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node and React.
