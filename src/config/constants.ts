    <div>
    Hello! My name is John and I enjoy creating things that live on the
    internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to
    try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking together a custom reblog
    button taught me a lot about HTML&nbsp;and&nbsp;CSS!
    </div>
    <div>
    Fast-forward to today, and I&rsquo;ve
    had the privilege of working at <a href="#">an advertising agency</a>, <a href="#">a start-up</a>, <a href="#">a huge
    corporation</a>, and a <a href="#">student-led design studio</a>. My main focus these days is
    building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at <a href="#">Upstatement</a>
    for a variety&nbsp;of&nbsp;clients.
    </div>
    <div>
    I also recently <a href="#">launched a course</a> that covers
    everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node and&nbsp;React.
    </div>
