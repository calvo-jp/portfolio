      Hello! My name is John and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My
      interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing
      custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a
      lot about HTML&nbsp;and&nbsp;CSS!

    <div>
      Fast-forward to today, and I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of working at{' '}
      <a href="#">an advertising agency</a>, <a href="#">a start-up</a>,{' '}
      <a href="#">a huge corporation</a>, and a <a href="#">student-led design studio</a>.
      My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital
      experiences at <a href="#">Upstatement</a>
      for a variety&nbsp;of&nbsp;clients.

      I also recently <a href="#">launched a course</a> that covers everything you need to
      build a web app with the Spotify API using Node and&nbsp;React.
