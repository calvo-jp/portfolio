Hello! My name is John and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML&nbsp;and&nbsp;CSS!

Fast-forward to today, and I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of working at [https://example.com](an advertising agency), [https://example.com](a start-up), [https://example.com](a huge corporation), and a [https://example.com](student-led design studio). My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at [https://example.com](Upstatement) for a variety&nbsp;of&nbsp;clients.

I also recently <a href="#">launched a course</a> that covers everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node and&nbsp;React.
